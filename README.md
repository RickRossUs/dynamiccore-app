# React Native App - User Form & Map Location  

This is a React Native application built with Expo that consists of two main features:  
1. A **User Form** that allows adding users with email validation and displays them in a list.  
2. A **Map View** that shows the user's current location on the map.  

## Features  

- **Home Screen**:  
  - Navigation options to access the **User Form** or the **Map View**.  

- **User Form**:  
  - Add users with `name` and `email` fields.  
  - Form validation ensures proper data entry (e.g., valid email format).  
  - Users added via the form are displayed in a list below the form.  

- **Map View**:  
  - Displays the user's current location on a full-screen map.  
  - Requires location permissions from the user.
